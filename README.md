<!-- Description of the Project -->
## About

### Introduction
The Kaggle Competition Solver is a project aimed to offer a wrapper on Machine Learning models to reduce repetitive operations such as initializing the data, saving and its generic structure for similar models. In this way, multiples problems can run the same algorithm without recoding from scratch each time.

The state of efficacity is not very high, meaning data augmentation by example or variations in the data format can break the execution.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Installation
For this project to work, some programs needs to be installed with the required Python libraries:
- Python 3.x
- All the modules prompted to be install (i.e. the links in the later section below, or accept the prompt to download from your favorite IDE, if possible)

## How to Execute
1- Create a project at the root of this repositry.
2- Create a profile with your favorite IDE and specify a run_x.py file as the main.
3- Use the run_template and the other examples to use the solver with your own problem to solve.
4- Import your data in the same way as the example (MNIST), with a prefix that is the global sinificative name of the competiton or problem to solve.
